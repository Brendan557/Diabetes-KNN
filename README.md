# Diabetes-KNN

In this kernel we will build a machine learning model using k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict whether the patients in the "Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset" have diabetes or not. I will compare the accuracy of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to a Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. The main point of this kernal is to apply the k-NN algorithm and use Cross-Validation to find the optimal number of neighbors.
